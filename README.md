# SuperResolution
Image Upscaling Tests using SRGAN (SRResNet)


Super-resolution (also spelled as super resolution and superresolution) is a term for a set of methods of upscaling video or images. Terms such as "upscale", "upsize", "up-convert" and "uprez" also describe increase of resolution in either image processing or video editing. Most super-resolution techniques are based on the same idea: using information from several different images to create one upsized image. Algorithms try to extract details from every image in a sequence to reconstruct other frames. This multiframe approach differs significantly from sophisticated image (single frame) upsizing methods which try to synthesize artificial details.

## SRGAN
SRGAN is a generative adversarial network for single image super-resolution. It uses a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss.
